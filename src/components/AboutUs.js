Chef Chai, owner and cook, strives to stay true to the five flavors of Thai cuisine by bringing the perfect balance of sweet, spicy, sour, savory, and bitter ingredients together in every dish.</p>
                              <p> &emsp;Our menu is designed to pay homage to Chaiâ€™s hometown of Bankgok and aims to showcase the common Thai street foods he grew up eating. Our food is the culmination of our Thai-Chinese roots and we feel the need to share it with the world!</p>
